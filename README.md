This project explores consumer perceptions and behavioral patterns regarding wearable healthcare devices, analyzing their attitudes and interactions to guide product development, marketing, and service improvements.

Objectives
The study aims to:

Assess the demographic and psychographic factors influencing wearable technology adoption.
Understand perceptions of value, usability, and service quality.
Segment users for targeted marketing strategies.
Methodology
Data Collection and Processing:

Data Source: Online survey data from Kaggle.
Key Variables: Gender, age, region, device customization, cost, usability, and health impact, measured using a Likert scale.
Preprocessing: Standardized data, handled missing values, and prepared for analysis through SPSS.
Statistical Analysis:

Measures of Central Tendency and Variance: Revealed general consensus in usability and rewards, with low variability in subjective attributes but higher in physical characteristics (e.g., height and weight).
T-tests: Identified gender differences in perceptions of customer service quality, with males rating it higher than females.
Factor Analysis:

KMO Test: Demonstrated data suitability for factor analysis with a high sampling adequacy score (0.921).
Components Identified:
Perceived Value and Service Quality: Focuses on pricing, customization, and service quality.
User Engagement and Support: Emphasizes daily use, connectivity, and motivational support.
Clustering Analysis:

Segmented respondents into two clusters:
Cluster 1: Valued service quality and engagement positively.
Cluster 2: Displayed negative perceptions of value and service, with lower engagement.
Insights: Significant variance in service quality perceptions but minor differences in engagement levels.
Findings
Perceptions of Wearable Devices:

Users value usability and reward systems, with positive attitudes towards customization and functionality.
Cost remains a critical determinant, with varying perceptions across demographics.
Segmentation Insights:

Cluster 1: Represents engaged users who appreciate service quality and device affordability.
Cluster 2: Reflects users who are critical of value and service aspects, requiring targeted efforts to improve satisfaction.
Behavioral Patterns:
